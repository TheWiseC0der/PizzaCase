# PizzaCase
a pizza ordering app to demo patterns and connections, using c# console applications.

the app consists of the following patterns so far:
* visitor, used to controll pricing of ingredients.
* composite, used to build pizza's with extra ingredients.
* (soon) singleton to manage server/client instances (for there should ONLY BE ONE).
